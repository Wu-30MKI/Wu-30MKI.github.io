I like for you to be still，it is as though you are absent

and you hear me from far away and my voice does not touch you

It seems as though your eyes had flown away

and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth

as all things are filled with my soul

your emerge from the things, fill with my soul

you are like my soul, a butterfly of dreams

and you are like the word melancholy

I like for you to be still, and you seem far away

It sounds as though you are lamenting, a butterfly cooing like a dove

And you hear me from far away, and my voice does not reach you

Let me come to be still in your silence

And let me talk to you with your silence

That is bright like a lamp, simple as a ring

You are like the night, with its stillness and constellations

Your silence is that of a star, as remount and candid

I like for you to be still: it is as though you are absent

distant and dull of sorrow, as though you had died

One word then, one smile, is enough

And I’m happy, happy that’s not true
